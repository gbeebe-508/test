## HMIS Participating Agencies

You can add a code chunk manually, using the Insert button at the top, or with CTRL + ALT + "I"

```{r participating}

hmis_participating <- raw_project %>%           #ALT + "-" gives you "<-" 
  filter(HMISParticipatingProject == 1)

```

```{r orgsize}

org_size <- hmis_participating %>%
  left_join(raw_organization, by = "OrganizationID") %>%
  group_by(OrganizationName) %>%
  summarise(Projects = n())                     # n() gives you a basic count

```
